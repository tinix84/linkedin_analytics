This increases yield and reliability. \n\nModular design means easier scalability and simpler layout on complex roofs or installations with multiple orientations. \n\nFor new installations or retrofits in variable-sunlight or shaded environments, microinverters combine robustness (weather-sealed, IP-rated housing) with the advantages of per-panel optimization.\n\nhashtag#SolarPV hashtag#Microinverter hashtag#CleanEnergy hashtag#Renewables hashtag#SolarDesign hashtag#EnergyEfficiency\nhashtag\n#SolarPV\n#\nhashtag\n#Microinverter\n#\nhashtag\n#CleanEnergy\n#\nhashtag\n#Renewables\n#\nhashtag\n#SolarDesign\n#\nhashtag\n#EnergyEfficiency\n#",

Inside this AcBel server PSU you get a CCM PFC front-end (UCC28019A), a phase-shifted full-bridge (UCC3895), SiC boost diode, synchronous rectification, Rubycon/NCC caps, and a PIC micro shepherding it all. \n\nLessons:\nArchitecture first. CCM PFC + PSFB is still the data-center workhorse because it scales, hits high PF, and keeps EMI tame with predictable current waveforms. \n\nDevice choice prints on your thermals. Swap a Si ultrafast diode for a SiC Schottky in the PFC and you nuke reverse-recovery losses and ringing. Less snubber pain, more efficiency margin. \n\nQuality BOM protects lifetime. Rubycon ZLH low-impedance electrolytics + Japanese HV cans aren’t bling—they’re why these bricks run for years at elevated temps. \n\nEfficiency context matters. Server PSUs routinely target 80 PLUS Platinum/Titanium curves; >94% at the sweet spot isn’t “marketing,” it’s table stakes. \n\nDIY with respect. Re-use is cool (e.g., rail-split + step-downs), but isolation/clearance, inrush, and supervisory logic are not optional. Use it like a lab platform, not a toy.\n\nTakeaway: Sometimes “cheap” on Xianyu is actually enterprise-grade design at salvage pricing.

That’s where the Parallel Coordinate Plot (PCP) comes in. This powerful tool allows engineers to analyze and compare multiple design variables simultaneously, providing insights into trade-offs and performance metrics that might otherwise be missed.\n\nIn power electronics, PCPs are especially useful for exploring high-dimensional optimization problems. By mapping out relationships between variables—such as switching frequency, efficiency, core material, and thermal limits—we can identify the best design paths that balance competing requirements.\n\nFor those interested in trying it, tools like pymoo's visualization module offer accessible ways to implement and customize parallel coordinate plots, making this method easier to integrate into design workflows.\n\nDo you use parallel coordinate plots in your optimization processes?

As we scale up 1-phase transformers, we observe interesting relationships between size, power rating, and efficiency:\n\n1️⃣ Economies of Scale in Power: Power scales with  while volume scales with . This means larger transformers become more power-dense, achieving higher power ratings without a proportional increase in volume.\n\n2️⃣ Managing Losses: Core and winding losses increase with volume, but cooling capacity scales with surface area. This requires advanced cooling for high-power systems to manage thermal limits effectively.\n\n3️⃣ Constant Power Density: For thermally limited designs, power density can remain constant even as transformers grow. By appropriately scaling surface area, we can manage increased losses, allowing larger transformers to handle more power without sacrificing efficiency.\n\nUnderstanding these scaling laws is crucial in high-power applications, where efficiency and thermal management play a significant role.

Tonight, we’ll explore three core statistics—**mean**, **variance**, and **correlation**—that serve as building blocks for understanding financial time series, market behavior, and risk. \n\n### **1. Mean: The Central Point of Data** \nThe **mean**, often called the average, is a measure of the central tendency of a data set. \n- **In Finance:** The mean is used to calculate the average return of a stock or portfolio over a specific period. \n**Example:** If a stock has daily returns of 2%, -1%, and 3%, the mean return is:  1.33%\n\n### **2. Variance: Measuring Risk or Dispersion** \nThe **variance** quantifies the spread of data points around the mean, giving a sense of volatility. \n- **In Finance:** Variance is critical for assessing the risk of an investment. High variance indicates high volatility, which means higher risk. \n**Example:** Using the daily returns of 2%, -1%, and 3%, the variance is = 2.22%\n\n### **3. Correlation: Understanding Relationships** \n**Correlation** measures the relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to +1. \n- **In Finance:** Correlation is used to evaluate how two assets move in relation to each other. A correlation of +1 means they move together, -1 means they move in opposite directions, and 0 means no relationship. \n**Example:** Stocks A and B have a correlation of 0.8. This suggests they are positively correlated, meaning their prices tend to move in the same direction most of the time. \n\n### **Why These Concepts Matter in Quant Finance** \n- The **mean** helps define expected returns, which is essential for evaluating investment opportunities. \n- **Variance** and **correlation** are crucial for **portfolio construction**, enabling you to optimize risk and diversification. \n- These metrics form the foundation for advanced techniques like **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** and **risk modeling**. \n\n---\n\n💻 **Exercise for Tonight:** \n1. Use Python to calculate the mean, variance, and correlation of a dataset of stock returns. \n2. Tools to try: \n - **Pandas** for handling data. \n - **NumPy** for statistical calculations. \n\n---\n\n💬 **Question for You:** \nHow do you currently evaluate the risk and return of an investment?

But is smaller always better? While high-density designs save space and reduce material costs, they often introduce significant challenges in **thermal management** and **system reliability**.\n\n## **Trade-offs of High Power Density**\n1️⃣ **Thermal Management Challenges** \n - Smaller converters pack more power into less space, leading to **higher heat dissipation per unit volume**. Without sufficient cooling, these designs can face overheating, reduced efficiency, and component failures.\n - **Example**: A high-density EV charger operating at peak load may require active cooling, which can offset size savings.\n\n2️⃣ **Efficiency vs. Size** \n - High-density designs often operate at higher switching frequencies to reduce the size of magnetic components. However, this increases switching losses, potentially lowering overall efficiency.\n - **Impact**: The reduced efficiency leads to additional heat generation, creating a cycle of thermal challenges.\n\n3️⃣ **Cooling Requirements** \n - High-density designs often need advanced cooling solutions like:\n - **Forced Air Cooling**: Adds complexity and noise.\n - **Liquid Cooling**: Increases cost and design complexity.\n - **Heat Sinks with High Thermal Conductivity**: Adds weight and bulk.\n - **Impact**: The cooling system may negate the space and weight savings of the high-density design.\n\n4️⃣ **Component Stress and Lifetime** \n - Operating components in smaller spaces increases thermal stress, which can reduce component lifetimes and compromise system reliability.\n\n## **When High Power Density Makes Sense**\nHigh power density is ideal for applications where **space and weight are critical**, such as:\n- **Aerospace Systems**: Where every gram counts.\n- **Portable Electronics**: Compact designs are a market requirement.\n- **Automotive Applications**: Limited space in EVs demands small converters.\n\nHowever, for stationary systems like **industrial power supplies**, prioritizing thermal performance over density may result in better long-term reliability.\n\ncredit: Bodo Arlt, Manfred Schlenk, Dr. Alfredo Medina Garcia, @christian wald\nBodo Arlt\nManfred Schlenk\nDr. Alfredo Medina Garcia",

    "content": "# **Day 3: Wednesday – Input Voltage Range: More Than Meets the Eye**\n**\"Why Input Voltage Range Can Make or Break Your Design\"**\n\n\nThe input voltage range is a critical specification in DC/DC converter design, but its impact often goes beyond what’s immediately visible. Whether you choose a wide input range or a narrow input range can influence nearly every aspect of your design—from component selection and reliability to cost and power density.\n\n## Wide Input Voltage Range: The Benefits and Challenges\n### Why Choose It?\nA wide input range offers exceptional flexibility, making converters suitable for a variety of applications with varying or unstable input sources, such as:\n- Electric Vehicles (EVs): battery voltages can fluctuate significantly during charging and discharging cycles.\n- Renewable Energy Systems with wide voltage variations depending on environmental conditions.\n\n### The Trade-offs:\n1️⃣ Reduced Power Density\nWider ranges demand larger magnetics to accommodate the variation in input conditions. This is particularly true for transformers and inductors, which need to handle increased energy storage without saturating.\n\n2️⃣ Complex Component Selection\nPower components like MOSFETs, diodes, and capacitors must handle the full input range, often requiring compromises in efficiency or cost.\n\n3️⃣ Cost Implications\nA wide input range typically necessitates more robust components, leading to increased system costs.\n\n## Narrow Input Voltage Range: The Focused Performer\n### Why Choose It?\nA narrow input range (e.g., 48–60V) allows for a more optimized design, making it ideal for systems with stable input sources, such as:\nTelecom Equipment: Operating on a fixed 48V power bus.\nIndustrial Power Supplies: Connected to regulated AC/DC converters.\n\n### The Trade-offs:\n1️⃣ Limited Flexibility\nNarrow-range converters are less adaptable to varying input sources. If the source voltage fluctuates outside the specified range, the converter may shut down or fail.\n\n2️⃣ Higher Efficiency and Power Density\nNarrow ranges allow for smaller magnetics and more optimized components. This results in higher power density, making them suitable for compact systems.\n\n3️⃣ Cost Savings\nComponents tailored for a narrow range can achieve better performance at a lower cost compared to wide-range designs.\n\n### Design Considerations:\n- Operating Environment: If your input source is highly variable (like solar panels or EV batteries), a wide input range is essential. For fixed sources, a narrow range is preferable.\n- Power Density Requirements: If size and weight are critical, a narrow input range can achieve better results.\n- Thermal Management: Wide input designs may require additional cooling due to larger components and increased losses under certain conditions.\n\nimage credit: https://lnkd.in/d_aB-VqP \n\nhashtag#PowerElectronics hashtag#InputVoltageRange hashtag#DCDC hashtag#Efficiency hashtag#ElectricVehicles hashtag#RenewableEnergy hashtag#TelecomEngineering\nhashtag\n#PowerElectronics\n#\nhashtag\n#InputVoltageRange\n#\nhashtag\n#DCDC\n#\nhashtag\n#Efficiency\n#\nhashtag\n#ElectricVehicles\n#\nhashtag\n#RenewableEnergy\n#\nhashtag\n#TelecomEngineering\n#",

These disciplines, essential in engineering, provide powerful tools for understanding the dynamics of financial markets.\n\n📈 How are they connected?\n\nSignal Processing: Market data, like a time series of stock prices, can be viewed as a signal. Identifying trends, filtering out noise, and detecting patterns use techniques similar to Fourier transforms or band-pass filters.\n\nDigital Filtering: Moving averages and other smoothing techniques are essentially filters applied to noisy market signals. For example, an EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is conceptually similar to a low-pass filter.\n\nControl Theory: Optimizing a portfolio or managing risk often mirrors the feedback systems in control theory, where the objective is to minimize deviation from a target (e.g., volatility or drawdown).\n\n\n🔍 Why does this matter?\nApproaching financial markets with tools from these fields provides a structured, systematic way to model and predict behavior. Just as we design controllers to stabilize systems or filters to enhance signals, we can design strategies to optimize financial performance.\n\n🚀 Next steps in this journey\nIn the coming days, we’ll explore how these engineering concepts can directly apply to quantitative finance, bridging the gap between two seemingly distinct worlds.\n\n👉 Question for you: Have you ever noticed parallels between your field of expertise and finance?

    "content": "🧐The Secret Design of Leakage Current: Balancing EMI and Safety in Power Electronics🧐\n\nIn EMI filter design, the Common Mode (CM) capacitor () plays a crucial role in reducing high-frequency noise. But there’s a hidden rule every designer must follow: leakage current limitations. Here’s how the right balance is struck between effective EMI attenuation and user safety:\n\n🛡️ Leakage Current Limitation and Safety Standards\n\nThe value of  is constrained by leakage current limits set by safety standards like EN 60335-1. For household and similar electrical appliances, the maximum allowable leakage current to ground is typically around 3.5 mA. Exceeding this limit can lead to safety risks, which is why controlling leakage current is essential in EMI filter design.\n\n⚖️ Finding the Optimal Capacitance Value\n\nTo keep leakage current within the safety limits, designers generally follow this rule: keep  for systems operating at 50-60 Hz. This ensures that the leakage current remains within acceptable bounds while still allowing  to perform its role in CM noise attenuation effectively.\n\n🔍 Capacitor Placement for High-Frequency Noise Attenuation\n\nIn a well-designed EMI filter,  is placed at the midpoint of the DC link to optimize the high-frequency (HF) loop. This positioning:\n\nReduces CM impedance, creating a low-impedance path for HF CM currents.\n\nEnhances noise attenuation in the high-frequency range without needing bulky inductors or complex filters.\n\n\n💡 Balancing Act: EMI Performance vs. Safety\n\nChoosing the right  value is about more than just meeting EMI standards—it’s a delicate balance between effective noise suppression and safety compliance. Too small a capacitor compromises noise attenuation, while too large a capacitor risks surpassing the leakage current threshold.\n\nThis \"secret rule\" of leakage current is often the fine line between robust, compliant filter design and safety risks.

    "content": "🔥🔥Minimizing EMC Filter Volume in High-Power Density Power Electronics: A Methodology🔥🔥\n\n\nFor applications requiring high power density, such as telecom power supplies, optimizing the size of EMC input filters in power converters is crucial. Our latest approach focuses on reducing the volume of the EMC filter in a **10 kW, three-level Vienna rectifier** while ensuring compliance with conducted emission (CE) standards (CISPR 22 Class B). Here’s how:\n\n### 📐 **Filter Design Approach** \nThe EMC filter is divided into:\n - **Common Mode (CM) Filter**: Designed using high-performance materials like VITROPERM 500F for inductors to provide strong attenuation with minimal leakage, optimizing both size and efficiency.\n - **Differential Mode (DM) Filter**: DM inductors utilize iron powder cores (such as MPP or High Flux) due to their high saturation flux density, which allows for smaller, compact components that can handle both high-frequency and mains-frequency currents.\n\n### 🔧 **Balancing Volume and Switching Frequency**\nOne of the challenges is achieving minimal filter volume while managing switching losses and thermal requirements. We calculated an **optimal switching frequency of 540 kHz** for forced air-cooled systems, balancing reduced component size with manageable cooling needs. Higher frequencies help shrink component sizes but come at the cost of increased heat dissipation.\n\n### 🔍 **Analytical Volume Optimization**\nOur approach avoids complex numerical optimizations, instead relying on an analytical method to calculate the minimum filter volume based on rated power and switching frequency. This allows for precise component selection and efficient design. By using empirical formulas, we can estimate the minimum volume necessary for desired attenuation, leading to smarter material and core size choices.\n\n### 📊 **Experimental Validation and Future Work**\nExperiments confirm that physical arrangement and component placement significantly impact EMC performance. Going forward, we aim to integrate **3D parasitic modeling** to enhance design accuracy and predict performance with greater precision.\n\n### Why This Matters\nIn high-density power applications, achieving minimal EMC filter volume is key for compact designs without compromising performance. This design methodology provides a framework for developing EMC-compliant filters tailored to today’s compact power systems.\n\nHave you tackled EMC challenges in high-power density designs?

    "content": "Switching Frequency and Filter Design: The 30% Reduction Trick\n(part 2)\n\nOne of the key benefits of increasing switching frequency in power electronics is the ability to downsize the filter components. Here’s how it works:\n\nWhen you double the switching frequency , you can achieve the same attenuation with a 30% reduction in the values of the LC filter components. The higher frequency shifts the noise spectrum upward, allowing the filter to achieve effective attenuation with lower inductance (L) and capacitance (C) values.\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\n1️⃣ Reduced Size and Weight: Smaller L and C values mean smaller physical components, contributing to a more compact design. This is especially valuable in applications where space and weight are at a premium, such as in electric vehicles and aerospace systems.\n\n2️⃣ Cost Savings: Reducing component values can lower material costs, especially for high-quality inductors and capacitors that tend to be pricier.\n\n3️⃣ Enhanced Efficiency: Smaller inductors can reduce core and copper losses, while lower capacitance minimizes reactive power, contributing to overall system efficiency.\n\nBut Remember the Trade-Offs\n\nWhile increasing  brings these benefits, it also introduces challenges:\n\nIncreased Switching Losses require better cooling solutions.\n\nControl Complexity rises, demanding faster and more precise control systems to keep up with the higher frequency.\n\n\nSo, when designing your filters, balancing frequency, component values, and system limitations is crucial.

This means reduced overall volume and weight, which is beneficial for compact designs.\n\n2️⃣ Challenges with Losses\nUnfortunately, increasing switching frequency isn’t without cost. Higher frequencies lead to increased switching losses, demanding larger heatsinks or more advanced cooling solutions. Inductor losses also rise, as both core and copper losses scale with frequency.\n\n3️⃣ Increased System Complexity\nHigher frequencies introduce additional system complexities, such as increased sensitivity to parasitics and challenges with gate driver immunity.

    "content": "IEEE 519: The \"Standard\" That Tries to Rule the Frequency Range of Nobody – Below 150 kHz and Above IEC 61000\n\n\n📐 IEEE 519 is often seen as the standard for managing harmonic distortion, but it operates in a strange middle ground. It primarily targets lower frequencies, leaving out much of the high-frequency noise that modern power systems contend with. Meanwhile, IEC 61000 focuses on harmonics up to the 40th order (2 kHz in a 50 Hz system) under IEC 61000-3-2 and IEC 61000-3-12, addressing emissions in the low-frequency range. For frequencies above 2 kHz and up to 150 kHz, standards like IEC 61000-4-13 and IEC 61000-4-7 step in, though they are more about measurement than prescriptive harmonic limits.\n\n🔎 The challenge here? As power electronics evolve, we're pushing systems to higher power levels with complex architectures. This results in harmonics and interharmonics across a wider spectrum—sometimes outside IEEE 519’s comfort zone and IEC 61000’s limits. For high-power applications, like fast EV chargers and renewable systems, we need standards that reflect modern grid realities. Current standards may either be too conservative, limiting innovation, or too generalized, missing critical frequency ranges.\n\n⚡ The solution is clear: while IEEE 519 and IEC 61000 give us frameworks, they may no longer be enough. As engineers, we need to ask if these \"standards\" truly address today’s power quality demands or if it’s time for a more adaptable, comprehensive approach.

    "content": "The Benefits and Trade-offs of Using Coupled Inductors in Power Converters\n\nIn power converter design, the choice of inductors—whether coupled or uncoupled—can significantly influence performance, efficiency, and EMI. Here’s a closer look at the impact of using coupled inductors:\n\n1️⃣ Potential for Volume Reduction\nCoupled inductors can help reduce the overall inductor volume compared to traditional uncoupled designs. By using magnetic coupling, core material can be used more efficiently, leading to potential reductions in core size. This is particularly beneficial in buck-boost converters, where a smaller core can directly contribute to lower volume and weight.\n\n2️⃣ Noise and EMI Reduction\nOne of the standout benefits of coupled inductors is EMI reduction. The coupling between windings can partially cancel magnetic fields, reducing radiated EMI. Some specific benefits include:\nMagnetic Field Cancellation: Coupled inductors can reduce radiated EMI through partial magnetic field cancellation between windings.\nCommon-Mode Noise Reduction: Properly designed coupled inductors can help attenuate common-mode noise—a major EMI contributor in many topologies.\nLeakage Flux Mitigation: When designed with toroidal cores, coupled inductors can contain magnetic flux more effectively, reducing stray fields and EMI.\n\n3️⃣ Performance Trade-offs and Design Complexity\nWhile coupled inductors offer clear volume and EMI benefits, they come with some trade-offs:\nIncreased Design Complexity: Coupled inductors require careful design and analysis, which may add complexity to the converter.\nUnintended Coupling: Without careful design, unintended coupling paths may emerge, potentially worsening EMI issues instead of solving them.\nFrequency-Dependent Performance: The EMI reduction benefits of coupled inductors are often frequency-dependent, so broadband EMI suppression may require special attention.\n\n4️⃣ Application-Specific Choices\nIn interleaved boost converters or multiphase DC/DC converters, the choice between coupled and uncoupled inductors can impact both volume and EMI. The actual volume reduction and EMI performance depend on the converter topology, power requirements, and operating conditions.\n\nConclusion\nCoupled inductors can be powerful tools for reducing EMI and optimizing volume in converters. However, their effectiveness depends on the specific design and application. For engineers, the decision often involves balancing efficiency, cost, EMI requirements, and complexity.\nHave you used coupled inductors in your designs?

Here’s how it works:\n\n1️⃣ Ripple Reduction: By interleaving multiple channels, both current and voltage ripple are significantly minimized. This reduction allows for smoother waveforms, as each interleaved path reduces ripple proportionally to  and  for current and voltage, respectively.\n\n2️⃣ Frequency Multiplication at No Extra Cost: Interleaving effectively multiplies the switching frequency by , enhancing system performance without adding to individual switching losses. This results in a higher effective frequency and lower ripple with the same energy efficiency.\n\n3️⃣ Massive Component Size Reduction: Thanks to the ripple cancellation effect, filter components can be dramatically downsized. We see reductions in capacitance by  and inductance by , leading to a more compact and cost-effective design.\n\n4️⃣ Control and Reliability: Advances in digital IC technology make it possible to control each interleaved phase precisely. The interleaving structure also allows for redundancy, enhancing reliability by allowing a large number of units to operate without compromising overall performance.\n\nParallel interleaving is ideal for applications requiring low ripple, high efficiency, and compact designs, such as high-performance DC-DC converters and inverters.\n\nWhat’s your experience with interleaving in power electronics?\n\nhashtag#PowerElectronics hashtag#Interleaving hashtag#HighEfficiency hashtag#ControlSystems hashtag#ConverterDesign hashtag#Reliability\n\ncredit Johann KOLAR European PhD School\nhashtag\n#PowerElectronics\n#\nhashtag\n#Interleaving\n#\nhashtag\n#HighEfficiency\n#\nhashtag\n#ControlSystems\n#\nhashtag\n#ConverterDesign\n#\nhashtag\n#Reliability\n#\nJohann KOLAR\nEuropean PhD School",

While this can significantly reduce semiconductor costs, it comes at a price in terms of power density.\n\nWith higher voltage devices, we deal with increased magnetic flux in inductors and transformers, requiring larger core sections to manage the flux within the same material limits. This ultimately impacts both gravitational and volumetric power density.\n\nSo while single-level, high-voltage designs might reduce complexity and cost, they introduce trade-offs in terms of size and weight that can’t be ignored, especially in space- and weight-sensitive applications. Choosing the right design approach always involves balancing these factors for the specific application requirements.\n\nhashtag#PowerElectronics hashtag#HighVoltage hashtag#PowerDensity hashtag#Magnetics hashtag#Semiconductors\nhashtag\n#PowerElectronics\n#\nhashtag\n#HighVoltage\n#\nhashtag\n#PowerDensity\n#\nhashtag\n#Magnetics\n#\nhashtag\n#Semiconductors\n#",

Imagine eating a slice of cake – delightful. Now, imagine eating the whole cake – overwhelming. The same goes for decision-making in an era of abundant information.\n\nWhile it’s important to be informed, too many options can lead to “analysis paralysis,” where we’re stuck trying to evaluate every possibility. This is where the idea of “perfection is the enemy of good” comes into play. Sometimes, the pursuit of perfection can slow us down rather than help us make optimal decisions.\n\nOne way to approach this is by distinguishing between reversible and irreversible decisions. For decisions that can be reversed, trust your judgment and act quickly. For those with lasting consequences, take more time. Additionally, narrowing down options can simplify the process and reduce the pressure to find the “perfect” answer.\n\nAbundance can often lead to anxiety and dissatisfaction. We tend to focus on what we didn’t choose, questioning whether we missed out on a better option. This is the paradox of choice – having too many options can make us less satisfied, not more.\n\nIn a world of infinite choices, let’s aim for satisfaction over perfection. After all, sometimes good is truly good enough.\n\nhashtag#DecisionMaking hashtag#PerfectionVsGood hashtag#ParadoxOfChoice hashtag#MindfulChoices hashtag#Leadership hashtag#PersonalGrowth hashtag#Productivity hashtag#Simplicity hashtag#LessIsMore hashtag#Focus\n\n------\n\nSuper Thinking: I modelli mentali per prendere decisioni migliori in meno tempo .

This allows us to ensure that individual parts meet necessary emissions and immunity standards before they’re integrated into larger systems. However, while components may perform well in isolation, their effectiveness can diminish when integrated into a vehicle.\n\nOnce we move to the vehicle level, the complexities multiply. The performance of each component heavily depends on how closely the integration mirrors the EMC setup used during testing. Often, integration involves electro-mechanical compromises that can lead to EMC degradation across different products.\n\nA significant challenge for vehicle architects is managing these compromises while ensuring that any degradation remains undetectable during vehicle-level EMC tests. This can be achieved through strategic design choices—like effective shielding and proper distancing from AC/DC inlets—to minimize interference and maintain compliance.\n\nAs we strive for optimal EMC performance, collaboration between component designers and vehicle architects becomes essential.

As power electronics continue to evolve, mastering magnetic design will be the ultimate differentiator.\n\nFor anyone in the field, investing in deep magnetic expertise is not just a necessity—it's your competitive edge. 💡⚡\n\nhashtag#PowerElectronics hashtag#MagneticDesign hashtag#Efficiency hashtag#GaN hashtag#SiC hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Innovation\nhashtag\n#PowerElectronics\n#\nhashtag\n#MagneticDesign\n#\nhashtag\n#Efficiency\n#\nhashtag\n#GaN\n#\nhashtag\n#SiC\n#\nhashtag\n#EngineeringLeadership\n#\nhashtag\n#Innovation\n#",

With promises of incredible efficiency and reduced costs, it seems like the perfect solution—potentially integrating tech like solar inverters directly into the vehicle's charging system. Sounds disruptive, right?\n\nBut here’s the reality: safety. Once you start a Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA), the number of ASIL D safety goals starts piling up faster than excuses from your IT department. \n\nFunctional and electrical safety remain key challenges preventing non-isolated OBCs from making it to the market.\n\nSometimes, power electronics feels like the easy part. It's when you add sensors, process complexity, and software integration that things become so complicated, you might start missing the days when a transformer was your biggest headache!\n\nFor now, non-isolated OBCs remain a dream on paper, but is there a way forward?

    "content": "🚨Why Passing EMC at the Vehicle Level is More Complex Than It Seems >> TOP 3 INTEGRATION ERROR by the OEM ,🚨\n\n\n\nI’ve seen it time and again—OEMs struggling to pass ECER10 at the vehicle level and wondering if the components like the OBC (On-Board Charger) are compliant. The truth is, even with fully compliant components, success is not guaranteed without careful consideration of the overall system design.\n\nHere is my favorite playlist of integration errors that can derail EMC compliance:\n\n1. Lack of a solid grounding concept at the vehicle level.\n\n2. Mixing noisy and clean cables, which cancels out the effectiveness of EMC filters.\n\n3. Failure to optimize the EMC setup during measurements because it’s often considered the technician’s job.\n\n4. No understanding of noise sources and their frequencies in different vehicle operating modes.\n\nIn my experience helping OEMs and suppliers achieve EMC compliance, addressing these issues early is key to success. It's not just about component compliance; it’s about system-wide optimization and knowing how to avoid these common errors.\n\nIf you’re facing EMC challenges or want to ensure a smooth certification process, I’m here to help.

    "content": "As fuel cell technology continues to advance, it's becoming increasingly important to understand the fundamental principles of fuel cell operation and control. One key concept in this field is the fuel cell equivalent circuit, a mathematical model that describes the electrical behavior of a fuel cell.\nThe fuel cell equivalent circuit consists of several key components, including a voltage source, a resistor, a capacitor, and a current source. These components can be adjusted to optimize the performance of the fuel cell, and can be controlled through various strategies, including open-loop and closed-loop control.\nOpen-loop control involves setting the values of the circuit components based on the desired operating conditions and performance requirements of the fuel cell. This approach is typically used in applications where the operating conditions are relatively stable and predictable. Closed-loop control, on the other hand, involves using feedback from the fuel cell system to adjust the values of the circuit components in real-time, based on the actual performance of the fuel cell. This approach can provide greater control and optimization of the fuel cell system, but requires more complex control strategies such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, Model-based predictive control (MPC), or Fuzzy logic control.\nUnderstanding the fuel cell equivalent circuit and control strategies is critical to optimizing the performance of fuel cell systems and unlocking their potential as a clean energy source.

    "content": "Hey! hashtag#compliance do you know about EV homologation standards?\n\nVehicle homologation is the process of certifying that a vehicle meets the regulatory requirements of a particular country or region. One critical aspect of homologation is compliance with electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards, which ensure that electronic systems in the vehicle do not interfere with each other or with other electronic devices in the environment.\nIn Europe, the ECE-R10 standard sets EMC requirements for vehicles, while in the United States, the FCC Part 15B regulation serves the same purpose. In China, the CCC certification for EMC is mandatory for high-risk electronic products, including vehicles, while in Japan, the PSE certification serves a similar function.\nCompliance with these standards is essential for vehicle manufacturers looking to sell their products in these regions. Non-compliance can lead to costly delays, product recalls, or even legal action. Furthermore, ensuring EMC compliance can improve the safety, reliability, and performance of electronic systems in vehicles, benefitting both manufacturers and consumers.\nAt the end of the day, vehicle homologation is about more than just meeting regulatory requirements. It's about building trust with customers by demonstrating a commitment to quality, safety, and environmental responsibility. By prioritizing EMC compliance as part of the homologation process, manufacturers can ensure that their products meet the highest standards of performance, reliability, and safety.\nhashtag#vehiclehomologation hashtag#EMCstandards hashtag#regulatorycompliance hashtag#safety hashtag#reliability hashtag#environmentalresponsibility\nhashtag\n#compliance\n#\nhashtag\n#vehiclehomologation\n#\nhashtag\n#EMCstandards\n#\nhashtag\n#regulatorycompliance\n#\nhashtag\n#safety\n#\nhashtag\n#reliability\n#\nhashtag\n#environmentalresponsibility\n#",

    "content": "Greetings, fellow engineers and designers! \n\nEMC, or Electromagnetic Compatibility, is a crucial factor in electronic equipment design. It refers to the ability of a device to function properly in the presence of electromagnetic disturbances. There are 4 main aspects of EMC: conducted and radiated emissions and immunity.\n\nConducted emissions refer to electrical signals that propagate along conductive pathways such as wires, cables, and printed circuit boards. Radiated emissions, on the other hand, are electromagnetic fields that propagate through the air or space. Both types of emissions can interfere with other electronic devices and cause malfunctions.\nImmunity, on the other hand, refers to the ability of electronic equipment to resist the effects of external electromagnetic disturbances. Just as conducted and radiated emissions can cause interference, external electromagnetic fields can also affect the operation of electronic devices. Immunity standards specify the levels of electromagnetic disturbances that a device should be able to withstand.\nEmission and immunity standards have been established by various organizations, such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). These standards specify the maximum levels of conducted and radiated emissions as well as the minimum levels of immunity that a device must meet in order to comply with regulations.\nBy taking a top-down approach to EMC, engineers and designers can better understand the overall framework and importance of emission and immunity in electronic equipment design. Stay up-to-date on the latest standards and ensure that your devices meet EMC requirements for optimal performance and reliability. hashtag#EMC hashtag#electronicdesign hashtag#engineering hashtag#conductedemissions hashtag#radiatedemissions hashtag#immunity.\nhashtag\n#EMC\n#\nhashtag\n#electronicdesign\n#\nhashtag\n#engineering\n#\nhashtag\n#conductedemissions\n#\nhashtag\n#radiatedemissions\n#\nhashtag\n#immunity\n#",

    "content": "Attention all electrifying innovators on LinkedIn!\n \nToday, I want to talk about the Control Pilot in the context of electric vehicle charging stations that comply with the IEC 61851 standard.\nThe Control Pilot is a communication signal that is sent between the electric vehicle (EV) and the charging station during the charging process. It is an essential component of the charging system, providing a reliable and safe charging experience for EV owners.\nThe Control Pilot provides information on the type of charging connection, the status of the charging process, and the maximum charging current that the EV can accept. This information is critical to ensure that the charging process is carried out in a safe and efficient manner, avoiding any damage to the EV's battery.\n \nIEC 61851:\nIn the IEC 61851 standard, the control pilot is a signal that is transmitted between the charging station and the electric vehicle (EV) to indicate the status of the charging process. The control pilot signal is a low-voltage DC signal that is sent over the proximity circuit, which is separate from the power circuit used to transfer energy between the charging station and the EV.\nThe control pilot signal has several functions, including:\nIndicating the maximum charging current that the EV can handle\nCommunicating the charging status to the EV driver\nControlling the charging process to ensure safety and efficiency\nThe control pilot signal uses a pulse-width modulation (PWM) technique to encode information, with different pulse widths representing different information.\n \nJ1772:\nThe J1772 standard, which is used primarily in North America, is based on the IEC 61851 standard, and includes similar provisions for the control pilot signal. \n \nGBT 18487:\nThe GBT 18487 standard, which is used in China, also includes provisions for the control pilot signal. \n \nhashtag#ControlPilot hashtag#ElectricVehicles hashtag#ChargingInfrastructure hashtag#IEC61851 hashtag#EVCharging hashtag#GreenEnergy\nhashtag\n#ControlPilot\n#\nhashtag\n#ElectricVehicles\n#\nhashtag\n#ChargingInfrastructure\n#\nhashtag\n#IEC61851\n#\nhashtag\n#EVCharging\n#\nhashtag\n#GreenEnergy\n#",

    "content": "Hello, LinkedIn community!\n \nAs the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) continues to grow, so does the demand for charging infrastructure. One of the most critical aspects of EV charging is understanding the different charging standards and protocols. \nIn this post, I'd like to provide an overview of the AC charging standards that are commonly used for EVs.\nAC charging is the most common method of charging for EVs, as it is widely available and provides relatively fast charging times. There are two main AC charging plugs that are used for EVs: Type 1 and Type 2.\nType 1 is used primarily in North America and Japan and is sometimes referred to as SAE J1772. It has a five-pin connector and supports charging rates up to 7.2 kW.\nType 2, on the other hand, is used primarily in Europe and is also known as IEC 62196. It has a seven-pin connector and supports charging rates up to 22 kW. Type 2 is the most widely used AC charging standard in Europe and is also gaining popularity in other parts of the world.\nBoth Type 1 and Type 2 charging standards use alternating current (AC) to charge the EV battery. The charging process is managed by the vehicle's onboard charger, which converts the AC power from the charging station into DC power that can be stored in the EV battery.\nIt's important to note that the charging rate and time for AC charging can vary depending on the EV model and the charging station. For example, some EV models may not support the maximum charging rate for a particular charging station, which can impact the charging time.\nAs an engineer or industry expert interested in EV charging, it's important to have a solid understanding of the different charging standards and how they apply to different EV models and regions. This knowledge is critical for designing, developing, and maintaining effective charging infrastructure that can meet the needs of the growing EV market.\nI hope this overview of AC charging standards has been helpful.
